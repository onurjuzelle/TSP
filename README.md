# TSP

 A solution to the TSP using different heuristic algorithms.
 
 - Input format is, identifier of the location and 2D Coordinates of the locations
 
 Example:
 

     1 4379, 6392
     2 5848, 2012
     3 2048, 2910

- ###  Nearest Neigbor Algorithm

Open a new terminal 

Make sure cmake is installed, navigate to the folder which contains the source code 

```cd [Path to the folder]```

- Use command ```make``` to compile the code 

- Use command ```./nearestNeighbourTSP [Input.txt]``` to run the code

```./[Program_Name] [Input_File_Name]```

- ###  Greedy Algorithm

Open a new terminal 

Make sure cmake is installed, navigate to the folder which contains the source code 

```cd [Path to the folder]```

- Use command ```make``` to compile the code 

- Use command ```./GreedyTSP [Input.txt]``` to run the code

```./[Program_Name] [Input_File_Name]```
